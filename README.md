### Step 1:

Install the dependenices via `yarn install` or `npm install`, whichever you prefer.

### Step 2:

Read the intro in [index.js](./index.js)

### Step 3:

Before getting started, let's take a minute to read through the spec, it's a quick read:

We'll look to break it down and implement it step-by-step in a TDD style of development.

### Step 4:

You can implement this either using a class or a function, in TypeScript or JavaScript.
If you're not sure, we'd recommend using a function because the implementation will
be smaller/simpler but won't hold it against you if you'd feel more comfortable using a class.
We use a mix of classes & functions as it makes sense in the Cypress Services codebase.

Go to ./src/ts/MyPromise.ts and comment out the export line, and then let's begin
to implement the "then" behavior

## Step 5:

Run `yarn test` / `npm run test` to get started
